now
- game needs to stop after 7 incorrect guesses

bugs 
- input should only count letters towards guesses (numbers count, punctuation marks are not)
- if clicking incorrect letter more than once, total guesses keeps accumulating and parts are still added 

data
- total guess count should be 0 if blank inputs are only thing entered 


if letter appears more than once in word, each instance needs to change color 
remove unused underscores
make sure word is still centered after removal of unused underscores
change randomWord color back to white
